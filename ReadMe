# 🏥 HealthCare Analysis

This repository contains SQL solutions for a Hospital Management System.
The tasks demonstrate real-world database operations, including querying, reporting, CTEs, window functions, and stored procedures.

All SQL scripts are organized into separate files for clarity and modularity.

### **✔️ queries.sql**

Contains all standard SQL queries (Tasks **1–13** and **16–19**) such as:

* Patient filtering
* Recent appointments
* Doctor & patient joins
* Treatment lookup
* Billing and outstanding balance checks
* Window functions (appointment ranking)
* Inserts, updates, and deletes

---

### **✔️ ctes.sql**

Contains Common Table Expression (CTE) queries:

* **Task 14:** CTE for bill statistics (AVG / MIN / MAX)
* **Task 15:** CTE for outstanding patient balances

---

### **✔️ stored_procedures.sql**

Contains stored procedures created for the project:

* **AddDoctor** → Inserts a doctor record
* **AddAppointmentWithValidation** → Inserts an appointment *after validating*:

  * Patient exists
  * Doctor exists

Both procedures include sample `CALL` statements.

---

### **✔️ functions.sql**

Placeholder file for SQL functions.
No standalone SQL functions were required, but this file is included for project completeness.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

To run the SQL scripts, you’ll need:

* PostgreSQL or pgAdmin
* The following tables pre-created in your database:

  * `Patients`
  * `Doctors`
  * `Appointments`
  * `Admissions`
  * `Bills`
  * `Treatments`
  * `Prescriptions`

## 🚀 How to Use

### **1. Clone the repository**

### **2. Open the SQL files**

Use:

* pgAdmin
* DBeaver
* VS Code
* Any PostgreSQL-compatible SQL editor

### **3. Run scripts as needed**

| File                      | Purpose                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **queries.sql**           | General SQL tasks         |
| **ctes.sql**              | CTE-based queries         |
| **stored_procedures.sql** | Creates stored procedures |
| **functions.sql**         | Placeholder               |
